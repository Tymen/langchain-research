# Interactive Assistant Research Project

## Overview

This project aims to explore the capabilities of AI-powered interactive assistants, particularly focusing on the integration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model with a custom vector database. The assistant, named ASkWatson, is designed to provide context-aware responses based on the user's queries and the contextual data stored in a vector database.

## Features

- **OpenAI GPT-4 Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's latest GPT-4 model for generating conversational responses.
- **Context Retrieval**: Integrates a vector database that stores and retrieves context relevant to user queries.
- **Dynamic Thread Management**: Maintains a continuous conversation thread, ensuring a coherent and contextually consistent dialogue.
- **Customizable Assistant**: Implements a set of predefined rules and behaviors that can be adapted for different research scenarios.
## Research Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to conduct research into the field of conversational AI and context-aware computing. By integrating a powerful language model with a custom-built vector database, this project seeks to investigate:

- The effectiveness of AI in understanding and responding to complex queries.
- The impact of context retrieval on the quality of conversational AI.
- The potential applications of AI-powered assistants in various domains.
